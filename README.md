### What the hell?
I don't want to recreate all my shits from scratch! This is my personal boilerplate for React Native/Expo project. This template utilizes ATOMIC design.

It's called Shock because you React.... Mmmmmmm.. K

### Testing
Lulz no Unit Test for now

### Linting
Lint configuration is based-off of [AirBnB Lint Config](https://www.npmjs.com/package/eslint-config-airbnb) with the alteration of the indention set to `4 spaces` and other not so strict shits.

To run the lint, navigate to the project folder and run `npm run lint`
To fix some of the linting errors, run `npm run lint-fix`

### Quickstart
1. Fork the repo
1. Navigate to the project folder

1. Expo Dashie and Compiler will be up
